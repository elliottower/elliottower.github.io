### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elliot. I enjoy creating tools for machine learning research, particularly Reinforcement Learning.

My personal interests include photography (see my [portfolio site](https://www.elliottower.com/)), travel, skiing, and music ([last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/ajsdlfkwer), [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/12132818380)). I previously competed professionally in eSports, and now volunteer as a photographer for in-person events (see my [blog](https://www.elliottower.com/stories/?category=events)).

ðŸ¤– Recent project: implementing two of my favorite board games and training RL agents: [gobblet-rl](https://github.com/elliottower/gobblet-rl) and [cathedral-rl](https://github.com/elliottower/cathedral-rl). 

ðŸ’¥ A live version of Gobblet running in the browser can be viewed [here](https://elliottower.github.io/gobblet-rl/) (using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), see my [tutorial](https://github.com/elliottower/gobblet-rl/blob/main/tutorials/WebAssembly/web_assembly.md) for details).

## Farama Foundation

ðŸš€ I am the Project manager for the [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) library, the standard API for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). 

To learn more, see [Announcing the Farama Foundation](https://farama.org/Announcing-The-Farama-Foundation) and the [Farama Team](https://farama.org/team).

## News

ðŸŽ‰ PettingZoo 1.23.0 is now live! ([release notes](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo/releases/tag/1.23.0)) This release standardizes the API to fully match Gymnasium, and includes many bugfixes, pickling support, and a documentation overhaul. Released alongside is SuperSuit 3.8.0 ([release notes](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/SuperSuit/releases/tag/3.8.0)) 

<!-- ![GitHub Release Date](https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) -->

ðŸŽ‰ I am excited to announce a mature release of [Shimmy](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Shimmy), an API conversion tool for using popular external RL environments with Gymnasium and PettingZoo ([blog post](https://farama.org/Announcing-Shimmy)) ([release notes](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Shimmy/releases/tag/v1.0.0))
