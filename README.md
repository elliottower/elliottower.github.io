### Hi there 👋

I'm Elliot. I enjoy creating tools for machine learning research, particularly Reinforcement Learning. 

🚀 I'm currently working on training RL agents for two of my favorite board games: [gobblet-rl](https://github.com/elliottower/gobblet-rl) and [cathedral-rl](https://github.com/elliottower/cathedral-rl). 

💥 A live version of Gobblet running in the browser can be viewed [here](https://elliottower.github.io/gobblet-rl/) (uses WebAssembly to run Python code in a virtual machine, see [tutorial](https://github.com/elliottower/gobblet-rl/blob/main/tutorials/WebAssembly/web_assembly.md) for details)
